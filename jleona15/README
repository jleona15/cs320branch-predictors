All trace outputs match the correct outputs given in the project description

The Makefile has the command "run-all" set to execute predictors with all
of the given traces.

I attempted the extra credit, but none of the methods I employed worked. TAGE
and local history didn't seem to work well at all, and although a perceptron
worked very well for predictions, it only did so with more bits used than the
tournament predictor. All methods technically work, but the accuracy of them
ranges from close to the tournament predictor to no better than chance. All
of them were designed to output to a separate output file, special_output.txt,
with the same data found in the other output files but with stats only for 
the extra credit algorithm(s).
